# Bookmark Separator

Sadly Chrome doesn't natively support bookmark separators.
This repository provides a page with a blank favicon [here.](https://jonatanschneider.github.io/bookmark-separator/), which you can use as a separator.


If you want to separate bookmarks horizontally, just edit the page title and fill it with dashes.
